Sustainable Development Solutions Network. He has also served as adviser to three U.N. secretaries-general and currently serves as a sustainable development solutions advocate under Secretary-General Ant\\u00f3nio Guterres. His latest article is headlined \\u201cThe Need for a New US Foreign Policy.\\u201d\\nTranscript\\nAMY GOODMAN: China is facing criticism in Europe after China\\u2019s ambassador to France questioned the sovereignty of former Soviet states under international law during a television interview. The Baltic countries Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia condemned the remarks and summoned Chinese envoys to explain Beijing\\u2019s official position. The Chinese Foreign Ministry walked back the ambassador\\u2019s comments, saying, quote, \\u201cChina respects all countries\\u2019 sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity.\\u201d\\nThe diplomatic spat comes as China is making headlines across the globe, though maybe not so much in the United States, for its diplomatic efforts. In late February, China released a 12-point peace plan to end the war in Ukraine. On March 10th, Iran and Saudi Arabia announced they would restore ties as part of an agreement brokered by China. Days later, in mid-March, Chinese President Xi Jinping hosted the Brazilian President Luiz In\\u00e1cio Lula da Silva to talk about Ukraine, trade and moving away from the U.S. dollar. Xi Jinping then met with French President Emmanuel Macron in Beijing. During Macron\\u2019s visit, Xi spoke about the roles of China and France in world affairs.\\nPRESIDENT XI JINPING: [translated] The world today is undergoing profound historic changes. As permanent members of the U.N. Security Council and major countries with a tradition of independence, China and France, as promoters of the multipolarization of the world and the democratization of international relations, have the ability and responsibility to transcend difference and restraints; adhere to the comprehensive strategic cooperative partnerships between China and France with stability, reciprocity, development and progress; practice true multilateralism; and maintain world peace, stability and prosperity.\\nAMY GOODMAN: While in Beijing, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, suggested France and European nations should not become a vassal of the United States when it comes to Taiwan.\\nPRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON: [translated] France supports the single China policy and the search for a peaceful solution to the situation for that matter. It\\u2019s Europe\\u2019s position. It\\u2019s a position that has always been compatible with the role of an ally. But it\\u2019s precisely one stressing the importance of strategic autonomy. Ally doesn\\u2019t mean being a vassal. It\\u2019s not because we do things together that we can\\u2019t think alone, that we\\u2019re going to follow the people in \\u2014 that are the toughest in a country that\\u2019s allied with us. When we look at the facts, France has lessons to be received from no one, be either in Ukraine, in Sahel or in Taiwan.\\nAMY GOODMAN: China has continued its diplomatic outreach by offering last week to hold talks between Israel and Palestine.\\nTo look more at China\\u2019s recent diplomatic actions, we\\u2019re joined by Jeffrey Sachs, director of the Center for Sustainable Development at Columbia University and president of the U.N. Sustainable Development Solutions Network. He has also served as adviser to three U.N. secretaries-general and currently serves as a sustainable development solutions advocate under Secretary-General Ant\\u00f3nio Guterres. His latest article published is headlined \\u201cThe Need for a New US Foreign Policy.\\u201d\\nProfessor Sachs, thanks so much for being with us. All of the diplomatic gestures of China \\u2014 you know, the meeting with Macron in Beijing, with Lula in Beijing, brokering this deal between Iran and Saudi Arabia, now offering not only to negotiate between Ukraine and Russia, but Israel and Palestine \\u2014 this hardly gets attention in the United States media. But around the world, the headlines are far more \\u2014 there are far more headlines about this. Talk about the significance of this, and if you see a direct parallel between all the headway that China is making and increasing U.S. hostility towards China.\\nJEFFREY SACHS: Thanks, Amy. Very good to be with you.\\nAnd indeed, this is a crucial topic. And as President Xi Jinping said in that meeting with Macron, this is a \\u2014 it is a historic watershed that the world is living through right now. What China is after, if we view it from China\\u2019s perspective, is what was also said: true multilateralism. And what that means, or true multipolarity, another term that they use, and that means they don\\u2019t want a U.S.-led world, they want a multipolar world. And the basis of that is that the United States is 4.1% of the world population, China is 17.5% of the world population. China\\u2019s economy is comparable to the U.S. economy, and indeed China is the lead trade partner for much of the world. So China is saying, \\u201cWe\\u2019re there, too, alongside you. We want a multipolar world. We don\\u2019t want a U.S.-led world.\\u201d\\nAnd while the United States sometimes talks about a rule-based order, the fact of the matter is that the U.S. grand strategy, if we can use that term of the grand strategists of the U.S. state \\u2014 see our grand strategy in the United States as being dominance. And I often refer to an article that I think is very clear, succinct and revealing by a former colleague of mine at Harvard University, Robert Blackwill, an esteemed ambassador of the United States, who wrote in 2015 \\u2014 and I\\u2019ll quote from the article \\u2014 \\u201cSince its founding, the United States has consistently pursued a grand strategy focused on acquiring and maintaining preeminent power over various rivals, first on the North American continent, then in the Western Hemisphere, and finally globally.\\u201d\\nWell, China doesn\\u2019t want the United States to be the preeminent power. It wants to live alongside the United States. Blackwill, writing in 2015, said China\\u2019s rise is a threat to U.S. preeminence. And he laid out a series of steps that the Biden administration actually is following almost step by step. What Blackwill laid out already back in 2015 is that the United States should create, quote, \\u201cnew preferential trading arrangements among U.S. friends and allies to increase their mutual gains through instruments that consciously exclude China.\\u201d There should be \\u201ca technology-control regime\\u201d to block China\\u2019s strategic capabilities, a build-up of, quote, \\u201cpower-political capacities of U.S. friends and allies on China\\u2019s periphery\\u201d and strengthened U.S. military forces along the Asian rimland despite any Chinese opposition. This has become the Biden foreign policy. China knows it. China really is pushing back.\\nBut what\\u2019s very important and interesting to understand, and we\\u2019ve seen it clearly in the dynamics involving the Ukraine war, most of the world also does not want the U.S. as the global preeminent power. Most of the world wants a multipolar world, and is, therefore, not lined up behind the United States\\u2019 sanctions on Russia and so forth. And this was also the message of President Lula visiting China, saying to President Xi Jinping, \\u201cWe, as Brazil, also want multipolarity, true multipolarity, and we want peace, for example, in the Russian-Ukraine war, that is based on not a U.S. perception of dominance \\u2014 say, NATO enlargement \\u2014 but rather a peace that reflects a multipolar world.\\u201d\\nThis is real. It\\u2019s happening all over the world. And the fact of the matter is, the reason why this is a historic watershed is that the underlying economics and technological change have made it so. The U.S. is no longer the dominant world economy, and the G7, which is the U.S., Canada, Britain, France, Italy, Germany and Japan, is actually smaller than the BRICS countries in economic size, which is Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa. So we really are, in fact, in a multipolar world, but in ideology, we\\u2019re in a conflict.\\nJUAN GONZ\\u00c1LEZ: Jeffrey Sachs, I wanted to ask about that. You mentioned the BRICS. The BRICS bank, that is now in China \\u2014 and President Lula has named Dilma Rousseff as the head of the BRICS bank \\u2014 its importance in terms of this multipolarity in the world economies, the potential for even the creation of alternative major currencies to the dollar as a result of the BRICS alliance, the impact of that on world affairs?\\nJEFFREY SACHS: This is a big deal. And in fact, the United States is withdrawing \\u2014 it doesn\\u2019t know it necessarily, our politicians don\\u2019t understand this, but our politicians are withdrawing from the world financial and monetary scene and opening up the space for a completely different kind of international finance.\\nI\\u2019ll give you an example. The U.S. was the creator of the World Bank. But now the U.S. Congress won\\u2019t put new money into the World Bank. And because of that, the World Bank is actually a quite small institution. It\\u2019s got a big name, but it\\u2019s a quite small institution in the financial scheme of things. The U.S. won\\u2019t put more money in. The Congress says, \\u201cNo. Why should we waste our money internationally?\\u201d and so forth, and you get a lot of hubbub about that. So, China and the rest of the BRICS say, \\u201cOK, we\\u2019ll make our own development bank,\\u201d and they established the New Development Bank, or sometimes called the BRICS bank, based in Shanghai.\\nAnd that\\u2019s just one of the institutions that is really changing the scene. There\\u2019s the Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank, AIIB, based in Beijing, in fact. There is, as President Lula said, and it\\u2019s happening also in the context of the Ukraine war, a move away from the use of the dollar, which the United States has thought, \\u201cWell, that\\u2019s our ace in the hole. You know, that is our ultimate hold on things, because we can use sanctions, we can use our financial control, to keep other countries in line.\\u201d But other countries are saying, \\u201cEh, not so much. We\\u2019ll trade in renminbi. We\\u2019ll trade in rubles. We\\u2019ll trade in rupees. We\\u2019ll trade in our own national currencies.\\u201d And they\\u2019re quickly setting up alternative institutions to do this.\\nThe United States doubles down: \\u201cWe will confiscate your reserves. We will, if you don\\u2019t follow.\\u201d And the other countries are saying, \\u201cYou know, if you want to go through the U.N. and get really multilateral rules, we\\u2019re with you. But if you want to just impose the rules, we won\\u2019t follow along.\\u201d And so, we have this very funny expression called a \\u201crule-based international order.\\u201d The United States government uses it every day. But what does it mean? Who writes the rules? And what most of the world wants, in fact, is rules written in a multipolar or multilateral setting, not rules written by the United States and a few friends and allies.\\nJUAN GONZ\\u00c1LEZ: I wanted to ask you \\u2014 you\\u2019ve been an adviser to the United Nations for quite often. The issue of how much longer the permanent members of the Security Council can keep the number to five? Because, clearly, Brazil and other countries of the Global South have been saying the U.N. needs to be reformed, and countries from Latin America, specifically Brazil, and Africa should have representation on the U.N. Security Council, permanent members.\\nJEFFREY SACHS: Yes, you know, the P5, the permanent five, which is the United States, China, Russia, France and the United Kingdom, was the World War II victor group in 1945. They wrote into the rules of the U.N., incidentally, that they would be the permanent Security Council members and have a veto over any change in the U.N. Charter. So it\\u2019s really a group that gave itself power that the other 188 countries of the world look on and say, \\u201cWhat is this? We need change.\\u201d\\nI would say the country that is most amazed and frustrated by this, in fact, is India. India is now the most populous country in the world. The United States has 335 million, roughly, in the population; Britain, France, roughly 60 million; India, 1.4 billion \\u2014 not on the Security Council, a nuclear power, a world superpower, the president of the G20 this year, really not happy about that. Brazil, the large \\u2014 largest economy of South America, similarly not on the Security Council. So, this has been an issue for more than 20 years. The P5, in various ways, have blocked particular countries, but, added up, the P5 have said, \\u201cYou know what? This is our club. We want to stay as the permanent five.\\u201d\\nBut I think as we really face the reality of a \\u2014 it\\u2019s not just a post-U.S.-dominated world, but actually a post-Western-dominated world, because it was the U.S. as the dominant power among the so-called West, which means the U.S., Britain, European Union, and honorary Western membership, Japan, let\\u2019s say. But we\\u2019re post-Western, as well as post-U.S. in dominance. And these international institutions need to change, or they won\\u2019t function in the 21st century. And if they don\\u2019t function, it\\u2019s actually a disaster for us. If they didn\\u2019t exist, we\\u2019d have to make them, because we need them to function, so we also need to renovate them.\\nAMY GOODMAN: I wanted to talk about China negotiating these various agreements. Let\\u2019s turn to Brazil\\u2019s President Luiz In\\u00e1cio Lula da Silva speaking before his meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping.\\nPRESIDENT LUIZ IN\\u00c1CIO LULA DA SILVA: [translated] What does Putin want? Putin can\\u2019t keep Ukraine\\u2019s territory. Maybe we don\\u2019t even discuss Crimea, but he will have to rethink what he has invaded. Also, Zelensky can\\u2019t have everything he wants to demand. NATO will not be able to set itself up at the border. So this is something we have to put on the table. \\u2026 I think this war has dragged on for too long. Brazil has already criticized what it had to criticize. Brazil defends each nation\\u2019s territorial integrity, so we disagree with Russia\\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.\\nAMY GOODMAN: Because it looks like Ukraine is on the verge of a major counteroffensive against Russia, and, in order to do this, needs massive support from Western countries, meaning military weapons, can you talk about what China\\u2019s role is here, the peace plan it has put forward, but also these other deals that China is helping to negotiate, like the successful rapprochement between Saudi Arabia and Iran, and then what they\\u2019re suggesting about Israel and Palestine?\\nJEFFREY SACHS: President Lula uttered, in a few words, the core of this issue, that our \\u2014 most of our media dare not explain to the American people, and that is the expansion of NATO. This is a war fundamentally about the U.S. attempt to expand a U.S. military alliance to Ukraine and to Georgia. Georgia is a country in the Caucasus, also on the Black Sea. The U.S. strategy, going back decades, has been to surround Russia in the Black Sea, with Ukraine, Romania, Bulgaria, Turkey and Georgia, all NATO members, surrounding Russia and its naval fleet in the Black Sea, with a naval fleet that has been the Black Sea naval fleet of Russia since 1783. Russia has said, \\u201cThis is our red line.\\u201d And it has said that for decades. And it said this clearly in 2007, before George W. Bush Jr. had the \\u2014 I\\u2019ll call it the harebrained idea to announce in 2008, and force NATO to announce, that Ukraine will be a member of NATO.\\nAnd this is what President Lula was saying and what President Xi Jinping of China has been saying: We can\\u2019t have a war that is essentially a proxy war between Russia and the United States over the expansion of the U.S. military alliance right up to a 1,200-kilometer and more border with Russia, which Russia views \\u2014 and I would say understandably views \\u2014 as a fundamental national security threat to Russia. Keep some space. Keep some distance. That\\u2019s President Lula\\u2019s meaning. That\\u2019s what China means when it says in its peace plan, \\u201cWe want a peace plan that respects the security interests of all parties.\\u201d What that is is code word for saying, \\u201cMake peace. End the war. But don\\u2019t expand NATO right up to the border.\\u201d\\nThe American people have not heard an explanation of this all along. It\\u2019s shocking to me, because as a close observer of this for 30 years, this has been the casus belli. And yet our newspapers won\\u2019t even report the background to this. But this is why China, South Africa, India, Brazil are saying, \\u201cWe want peace, but we don\\u2019t want NATO expansion as the meaning of so-called peace. We want the big superpowers to give each other some space and some distance, so that the world isn\\u2019t on a knife edge.\\u201d That\\u2019s exactly what President Lula was saying, and it\\u2019s exactly what the meaning of the Chinese peace initiative is, is to say, \\u201cYes, absolutely make peace. Protect Ukraine\\u2019s sovereignty and its security. But no to NATO expansion.\\u201d\\nBut the Biden administration won\\u2019t even discuss this issue. That has been the major failing and the reason why we have not been able to get to the negotiating table, in my opinion, even when Zelensky said in March 2022, \\u201cMaybe not NATO, maybe something else.\\u201d Russia and Ukraine were close to an agreement, and the United States intervened with Ukraine and said, \\u201cWe don\\u2019t think that\\u2019s a good agreement,\\u201d because the U.S. neocons, so-called, have been pushing for NATO enlargement as the core of this issue.\\nBut this goes back to the more general point for us, which is that what is at stake in Ukraine and over Taiwan and many other issues, from the point of view of China or Russia or other countries, including Brazil, now Saudi Arabia, Iran and others, is whether the U.S. does what it wants to do or whether the U.S. respects some limits based on what other countries say, \\u201cWell, this is what we think, so that we need true multipolarity, not U.S. dominance alone, rules written by all of us, not rules written just by the United States.\\u201d\\nJUAN GONZ\\u00c1LEZ: And, Jeff Sachs, we only have a few \\u2014 about a minute left, but I was wondering if you could comment on the parallels between this expansion of NATO further and further east in Europe \\u2014 this year marks the 200th anniversary of the Monroe Doctrine, of President Monroe declaring to all the European powers that the Western Hemisphere was off-limits to them coming, attempting to move their forces and their militaries into Latin America. And for these past 200 years, Latin America has essentially been the major sphere of influence of the United States. And yet, here we are, saying that Russia has no right to declare that its immediate \\u2014 the countries on immediately its borders cannot welcome in NATO troops.\\nJEFFREY SACHS: Well, yes, a little empathy would go a long way, would have spared us, actually, a lot of wars. But for Americans, it would be useful to think: Suppose Mexico made a military alliance with China. Would the United States say, \\u201cWell, that\\u2019s Mexico\\u2019s right. What are we going to do about it?\\u201d Or might there be actually an invasion in short order or something like that? I would strongly advise to China and Mexico, don\\u2019t try it at home. Don\\u2019t experiment with this. But the United States government refuses that empathy, because \\u2014 in other words, refuses to put itself in the position of the other side. That\\u2019s the fundamental arrogance of thinking that you determine the rules of the world. The problem with arrogance is not only the comeuppance from it, but you can\\u2019t \\u2014 you stumble into terrible crises that you don\\u2019t even understand, because the United States has not been allowed \\u2014 the public has not been allowed to even think from the perspective of the other side. So, the analogy is actually a very, very clear analogy. It is what China and Russia and others say all the time, is, \\u201cWhy have those double standards? Why don\\u2019t we actually deal with each other with mutual respect, not with the rules that you write?\\u201d\\nAMY GOODMAN: We want to thank you, Jeffrey Sachs, for joining us, director of the Center for Sustainable Development at Columbia University, president of the U.N. Sustainable Development Solutions Network.

In\\u00a0Check Your Financial Privilege, he says it, starting with the fact that anyone born into a reserve currency like the euro, yen, or pound has financial privilege over the 89% of the world population born into weaker systems.In Nigeria, human rights activists depend on Bitcoin for donations after crackdowns by authoritarian regimes. In Cuba, after a dual-currency system devalued the peso, those who saved in Bitcoin managed to stay afloat. In El Salvador, where remittance fees and exchange rates can eat away a simple money transfer to family members in need, Bitcoin offers hope with lower fees and faster transactions (and now it's legal tender).As CSO of the Human Rights Foundation, Gladstein is uniquely positioned to detail the rise of Bitcoin from cypherpunk dream to the real-life Bitcoin stories happening to real people across the globe. For people around the world, outside of Wall Street, Bitcoin offers a means of freedom from inflation, political strife, and an outdated monetary system.

Uzo Aduba plays fellow scientist Hawthorne, who is married to another woman. A kiss between her and her wife was cut from the film and later reinstated amid the \\u201cDon\\u2019t Say Gay\\u201d bill-backing backlash toward Disney. The film is currently banned from release in Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Kuwait due to LGBTQ+ themes \\u2014 not unexpected over some Middle Eastern countries\\u2019 approach to gay material in movies, however implied or slight.\\nWhen asked by Variety about Pixar standing by the kiss, Evans said, \\u201cI mean, it\\u2019s great. As great as it is \\u2014 and you know, I\\u2019ve been asked the question a few times \\u2014 it\\u2019s nice, and it\\u2019s wonderful, it makes me happy. It\\u2019s tough to not be a little frustrated that it even has to be a topic of discussion. That it is this kind of \\u2018news.\\u2019 The goal is that we can get to a point where it is the norm, and that this doesn\\u2019t have to be some uncharted waters, that eventually this is just the way it is.\\u201d The \\u201cCaptain America\\u201d star continued, \\u201cThat representation across the board is how we make films. Look, it\\u2019s an honor to be a part of something that is taking those steps, but the goal is to look back on this time and just be shocked that it took us this long to get there.\\u201d\\nAnd as \\u201cLightyear\\u201d is one step for mankind, Aisha\\u2019s love story onscreen is also a crux of the plotline, with her granddaughter Izzy, voiced by Keke Palmer, a pivotal character. Aisha also inspires Buzz\\u2019s \\u201cto infinity and beyond\\u201d catchphrase.\\n\\u201cI thought it was beautiful. That\\u2019s the best thing about Pixar, being able to kind of take these great catchphrases that Tim Allen originated and made so iconic and create origin stories for all of them,\\u201d Evans shared. \\u201cIt\\u2019s basically a movie full of easter eggs, and it\\u2019s incredibly satisfying. But it\\u2019s a little daunting because those words are precious, not just to me, but the fans of Buzz Lightyear, the fans of Tim Allen, and you want to honor them as best you can.\\u201d\\nEvans added that he \\u201csobbed\\u201d during the montage of Aisha\\u2019s love story.\\n\\u201cI don\\u2019t think I\\u2019ve ever seen a Pixar movie where I didn\\u2019t cry,\\u201d Evans said. \\u201cThey have the recipe, they really do.

A 25% duty was essentially the level Trump announced for those two countries during his shock “Liberation Day” speech on April 2.\n","\n","Later Monday afternoon, he posted letters threatening duties of as much as 40% on goods from Laos and Myanmar, along with ones of 30% for goods from South Africa and 25% for ones from Malaysia and Kazakhstan.\n","\n","Trump would seek to impose the tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. His ability to do so remains but is under court review.\n","\n","Markets had already opened the week lower after mixed messaging over the past 72 hours from White House officials about the importance of a deadline of Wednesday that Trump set in April after relenting on imposing the eye-watering country-by-country tariff levels he’d announced one week prior.\n","\n","After the two letters went live on Truth Social, markets briefly took another leg lower, with the broad S&P 500 stock index falling as much as 1%.\n","\n","During her regularly scheduled media briefing Monday afternoon, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Trump would sign an executive order extending the Wednesday deadline to August 1.\n","\n","It represents a return to the back and forth, on-again, off-again state of affairs that prevailed leading up to, and shortly after, Trump’s April 2 speech announcing extreme import duties on dozens of nations. The moment led to one of the worst market sell-offs on record. During some particularly chaotic moments, Trump changed tariff levels in the span of a few hours.\n","\n","The president eventually relented on immediately imposing those duties in announcing the pause, and since then, stocks have slowly rallied back to all-time highs.\n","\n","Heading into this week, the ground already looked set for the deadline to lose its significance. Asked Friday whether the U.S. would be flexible with any countries about the deadline, Trump said, “Not really.”\n","\n","He continued: “They’ll start to pay on Aug. 1. The money will start to come into the United States on Aug. 1, OK, in pretty much all cases.”\n","\n","Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent attempted to clarify those comments Monday, telling CNBC: “President Trump has said … countries would not go back to the reciprocal rate until Aug. 1.”\n","\n","While he expects to have “several” announcements in the next 48 hours, Bessent said, the president is more focused on the “quality” of deals, not the “quantity” — though he did not provide details on the nature of the proposed announcements.\n","\n","So, what comes next?\n","\n","Perhaps the clearest description of the state of play came from White House spokesman Kush Desai, who told The Wall Street Journal that any decisions around trade would come directly from Trump himself.\n","\n","In other words, all deals and deadlines will remain in flux as long as the president says so.\n","\n","To date, the president has announced limited new arrangements with the U.K. and China, as well as a brief statement on a pact with Vietnam. In a social media post Sunday, Trump wrote that “the UNITED STATES TARIFF Letters, and/or Deals, with various Countries from around the World, will be delivered starting” at noon Washington time Monday.\n","\n","Trump was already threatening new tariff duties late Sunday, writing in a Truth Social post that an additional 10% tariff, on top of the existing across-the-board 10% baseline, would be imposed on any country aligning themselves with policies set by the BRICS bloc, comprising Brazil, Russia, China and India. The post came as leaders of the bloc met in Rio de Janeiro.\n","\n","It was not immediately clear what Trump’s rationale is for that assertion.\n","\n","Some on Wall Street were more optimistic that the return of uncertainty may not weigh as heavily on stocks this time around.\n","\n","“Our base case remains that the uncertainty around tariffs won’t be enough on its own to bring the US economy to a crashing halt,” analysts with Capital Economics research group and consultancy wrote in a note to clients Monday. “If so, it’s unlikely to be enough to dampen investors’ enthusiasm for US equities.”\n","\n","Yet the analysts also acknowledged that renewed chaos could prove a setback for officials at the Federal Reserve, who continue to insist on keeping interest rates high, despite repeated demands from Trump for a rate cut. Rates have remained elevated in anticipation of worsening inflation as a result of the import taxes. It’s something that will continue to make it expensive for the federal government, not to mention consumers and businesses, to borrow money, the analysts said.\n","\n","“It’s been clear in recent weeks that many [Federal Reserve officials] are not confident about cutting rates until the inflationary effects of tariffs are clearer, and we doubt they’ll cut this year,” they wrote.\n","\n","\n","\"\"\"]\n","dataset = Dataset.from_pandas(pd.DataFrame({\"text\": texts}))\n","\n","tokenized = dataset.map(lambda x: tokenizer(x[\"text\"], truncation=True, padding=True, max_length=512), batched=True)\n","\n","pred = trainer.predict(tokenized)\n","logits = pred.predictions\n","\n","\n","import torch\n","\n","probs = torch.softmax(torch.tensor(logits), dim=1).numpy()\n","\n","top3 = np.argsort(probs, axis=1)[:, -3:][:, ::-1]\n","\n","for i in range(len(texts)):\n","    print(f\"\\n🔍 text：{texts[i][:50]}...\")\n","    for j in range(3):\n","        label = le.inverse_transform([top3[i][j]])[0]\n","        prob = probs[i][top3[i][j]]\n","        print(f\"  {j+1}. {label} ({prob:.2%})\")"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":153,"referenced_widgets":["e7a867b9e02c47ae934eeac77d7f9d9a","7a9377a4a1bd4e17aa8dc475ce420309","ba1e4971cb93475eaed316133058fa55","576cca1a175842969fca228316c86ddf","0141a707bcd0432fb62bbfe0d5d31e47","719b1c2187904ae6a171314dbfdc0fa4","5e8ef1ffe61b47e481d5d3b805749c90","4cbbb1beabe34cada94e0a460dd0a6d3","fb535da9859148539ebd9883e1c2da09","1d016ffe70524b4eab2a8cc14c6581ec","98d7fab93df240d28c86a21c7b62187e"]},"id":"xXRuKeNDLs-V","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1751950527308,"user_tz":-480,"elapsed":123,"user":{"displayName":"Ye Siang Goh","userId":"09932076899114634052"}},"outputId":"17c2f90b-000b-41d8-c582-2cd12b9da88e"},"id":"xXRuKeNDLs-V","execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["Map:   0%|          | 0/1 [00:00<?, ? examples/s]"],"application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"e7a867b9e02c47ae934eeac77d7f9d9a"}},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["<IPython.core.display.HTML object>"],"text/html":[]},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["\n","🔍 text：\n","The trade war chaos that engulfed the early month...\n","  1.

The summer competitions range from archery and basketball to gymnastics and swimming, while the winter competitions range from alpine skiing and bobsleigh to figure skating and snowboarding.\n","\n","People from all around the world tune in to watch the physical prowess of Olympic athletes as they perform feats of strength, speed, endurance and skill. The first day of the 2024 Paris Olympics alone drew more than 32 million viewers.\n","\n","But the Olympics are more than just a celebration of athletic achievements; they’re a platform for promoting solidarity, according to Jonathan Casper, also a professor in the Department of Parks, Recreation and Tourism Management.\n","\n","“The Olympics are unlike any other sporting event in the world because of their capacity to unite people through a shared enthusiasm for sport on a global scale,” Casper said.\n","\n","Casper and Bocarro have both spent years studying the legacy of mega-sporting events like the Olympics. While these events aren’t always environmentally friendly or financially beneficial for host cities, they can have positive impacts.\n","\n","Some examples from the Olympics include:\n","\n","Cultural Exchange\n","The Olympics bring together athletes and spectators from around the world to a single host city, creating a melting pot of languages, traditions and customs.\n","Olympic athletes and spectators have the opportunity to explore the host city’s culture — from food and fashion to music and art. Even those watching from other countries can appreciate the city’s architecture and atmosphere.\n","The Olympic Village serves as a microcosm of the world, providing a shared living space where athletes learn about each other’s customs and traditions.\n","Diversity, Equity and Inclusion\n","The Olympics celebrate diversity and inclusion on a global scale by hosting more than 10,000 athletes from around the world for athletic competition, irrespective of social background, gender, race, sexual orientation or political belief.\n","Gender-based discrimination is still rampant in the world of sports. The Olympics provide a platform for promoting gender equality and empowering women and girls, with an equal number of male and female athletes competing.\n","Sport Marketing and Development\n","The Olympics promote non-traditional sports to a global audience. Skateboarding experienced increased interest following its debut at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.\n","Olympic athletes can serve as positive role models for kids, especially when they learn about the trials and tribulations they had to overcome.\n","Surveys show that the Olympics attract more female viewers, presenting an opportunity for increased sponsorships and media coverage.\n","The Olympics showcase the expertise of smaller countries in certain sports. Cuba, for example, ranks only second to the United States in boxing.\n","National and Civic Pride\n","The Olympics serve as the ultimate show of national pride and identity. While countries don’t compete in the Olympics, athletes represent their countries in individual and team competitions.\n","One global poll conducted by the BBC found that a majority of people in 18 out of 21 countries said their nations’ performance at the 2012 London Olympics was “important to their national pride.”\n","Research shows that some individuals also feel civic pride when their cities host the Olympics and other mega sporting events. This is largely due to increased visibility, whether it’s through tourism or broadcasting.\n","Sustainability\n","The relationship between mega sporting events and sustainability is fraught with controversy as many experts argue that organizers lack transparency and often fail to minimize their negative impacts on the environment.\n","Research shows that mega sporting events can cause increases in carbon emissions related to transportation, energy usage and waste generation.\n","But the Olympics and other mega sporting events can help to raise awareness of environmental issues. The 2024 Paris Olympics, for example, brought attention to pollution levels in the Seine River.\n","\n","\"\"\"]\n","\n","\n","dataset = Dataset.from_pandas(pd.DataFrame({\"text\": texts}))\n","\n","tokenized = dataset.map(lambda x: tokenizer(x[\"text\"], truncation=True, padding=True, max_length=512), batched=True)\n","\n","pred = trainer.predict(tokenized)\n","logits = pred.predictions\n","\n","\n","probs = torch.softmax(torch.tensor(logits), dim=1).numpy()\n","\n","top3 = np.argsort(probs, axis=1)[:, -3:][:, ::-1]\n","\n","for i in range(len(texts)):\n","    print(f\"\\n🔍 text：{texts[i][:50]}...\")\n","    for j in range(3):\n","        label = le.inverse_transform([top3[i][j]])[0]\n","        prob = probs[i][top3[i][j]]\n","        print(f\"  {j+1}. {label} ({prob:.2%})\")"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":171,"referenced_widgets":["be23cf83c7e0434990543736c04d5196","6f40d776cd7d45fb84fbed10c14eafc0","8ef88239baeb4c4f809c89390eff14aa","afbf59baceae47d9afd98e6bec0000e2","34d9d4e3d8fa418b93ef4cb93a175c05","f3eb9562e4ea4ccfb9bd31c1b9210560","3c0a8072a0a641148062ca249b1dfb93","867dd2342713487bbe400eb796b5da02","050d72d2fa614e53aca1707f388af57e","89ba4f7cf0b143aa8be7567bb456ccb9","1e6d0047f71f4810a81a2063d1924431"]},"id":"iXsd2Jd7Im_S","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1752206729448,"user_tz":-480,"elapsed":97,"user":{"displayName":"Ye Siang Goh","userId":"09932076899114634052"}},"outputId":"84f485b4-7dc7-46ac-c699-031c98cbcca5"},"id":"iXsd2Jd7Im_S","execution_count":24,"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["Map:   0%|          | 0/1 [00:00<?, ? examples/s]"],"application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"be23cf83c7e0434990543736c04d5196"}},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["<IPython.core.display.HTML object>"],"text/html":[]},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["\n","🔍 text：\n","\n","The Olympics are often regarded as the world’s f...\n","  1.
